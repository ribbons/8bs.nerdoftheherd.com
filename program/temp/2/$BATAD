SALE OF THE CENTURYSadly, I have packed my BBC Master 512 Computer, carefully away. Space is nowthe problem, because over the years I have collected a great deal of software- with all the bells and whistles - to enable me to do most things. A verywelcome birthday and retirement gift of a PC is my reason for this sale.The Computer and all the peripherals are very clean, well maintained and ingood working order. I would prefer to sell the lot as one sale. The recipientwill have everything he/she needs and could have a truly excellent computer tomeet all their needs. A case of unpacking, attaching all cables and away yougo with complete reliability.As regards price, I was thinking in the order of `200, with the recipientcollecting, and for that they would be obtaining;A Master 512 Computer, Double Pace Disc Drive (own power supply), Spare DoubleOpus Disc Drive (Connect to Master) 40/80 track switched, Star 24-10Multi-Font printer including Service Manual, MicroVitec colour monitor, SC84Programmer (professionally designed and built) with driving software, Largeselection of original software and manuals, Large collection of 5.25" Discsfilled with programs (no games), 120 Beebug magazines/books (the completebound set), Fanfold paper, labels and window envelopes. All packed away in 5cardboard boxes. In addition I have a second 1 Mbyte MOS original ROM, along with some 30 ROMs(BCPL and so on), some 50 TTLs, and a couple of machine programming books.The computer is also fitted with a Vine Micros Master Romboard 4, VineMicros ROM Extension Board both fully populated and, of course, theCo-Processor Board.The machine is configured with: Master ROM (Beebug), OverView(Acorn), Basic Ed& Tools(BET), Wordwise Plus II, DFS (Beebug 2.45 upgrade), SpellMaster(CC),Basic, View, Terminal.Mr John Battersby 107 Richmond Terrace DARWEN Lancashire BB3 0HETelephone: 01254 775101 (After 11am please).
