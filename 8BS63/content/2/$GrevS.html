<br />FREE GAMES!<br />~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Games Reviewers Wanted!<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />8-Bit Software has been in contact with David Bradforth at ProAction and<br />Steve Hanson at Superior Software.<br /><br />They have sent me some games to advertise their wares. All that they ask for<br />in return is a review for each of the games in 8BS magazines.<br /><br />Here's how you get your free games:<br /><br />8BS sends the game to the reviewer. The game is supplied on approval for one<br />month. Before the expiry of the approval period, one of the following<br />conditions will be met:<br /><br />1. A review meeting the criteria set by 8BS would be received by 8BS<br /><br />OR<br /><br />2. Payment of the full price of the game to ProAction or Superior Software if<br />   no review is received by 8BS<br /><br />The criteria for 8BS reviews are as follows:<br /><br />1. Game Title<br /><br />2. From where available (ProAction or Superior Software)<br /><br />3. Price including all charges<br /><br />4. Price to 8BS members including all charges<br /><br />5. Type of game (Adventure, zapping etc)<br /><br />6. Scenario of the game<br /><br />7. Size of the game (number of levels etc)<br /><br />8. Description of game play<br /><br />9. Your opinions of the game<br />   a) Graphics<br />   b) Sound<br />   c) Game play<br />   d) Value for money<br /><br />I would expect a minimum of 500 words in the whole review which would cover<br />all the above points. I would accept fewer words for each game on a<br />compilation disc, but would expect a review for each of the games on that disc.<br /><br />The following games are at 8BS waiting for you to play them:<br /><br />ProAction Games:<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />None avaiable at Present AGAIN!<br /><br /><br />Superior Software Games:<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Play it Again Sam 12<br />Play it Again Sam 13<br />Play it Again Sam 14<br />Play it Again Sam 15<br />Play it Again Sam 16<br />Play it Again Sam 17<br /><br />Reviews will be placed on 8BS issues and are gathered together onto TBI-111.<br /><br />    </td></tr></table>
