Castle Quest Solution <br /><br /><br /> First go up the ladder on your right, go left at the top and along to the next<br />ladder. Jump the gap at the top of this ladder and go up to the other ladders<br />to collect the ruby.<br /> Next, return to the starting leveland go right to the Troll's bridge. Start to<br />cross, and as the Troll emerges drop the ruby. When the Troll has taken it to<br />his lair, run across the bridge, through the wall and up the next ladder. Jump<br />all the gaps until you reach two parallel ladders: To cross them, get to the<br />edge of each one, press right and jump. Collect the first torch and then make<br />your way back and collect the gold bar. Practice getting on to the ladder will<br />come in useful later.<br /> Return to the Troll, this time using the gold bar as bait. Now go back to<br />where you collected the ruby and take the second torch. Then go to the starting<br />level and get the remaining torch.<br /> Descend the ladders to the bottom of the screen and block off the bottom of<br />the far left and far right ladders with torches.<br /> If you climb the middle ladder and stand at the right hand side you can catch<br />all the red men.<br /> Collect the torch you put at the bottom of the right ladder and leave it<br />slightly to the left of the middle ladder. The torch at the top of the middle<br />ladder should now be placed on top of the left ladder.<br /> Now remove the torch at the bottom of the left ladder so that the red men will<br />run into the spiders' area. Quickly follow the first red man, collect the sword<br />and run out. Leave all the torches where they are for later use.<br /> To get out of prison, pick up the stool, and move beneath the torch and, while<br />jumping, throw the stool upwards to knock the torch down. Stand on the stool to<br />get onto the porch above the door, and from there throw the torch at the bed:<br />The guard will run in and you can then jump down, grab the stool and leave.<br /> Store the stool and (using jump and up) climb the ladder just left of the<br />prison. When the guard goes past come down, pick up your objects and kill the<br />guards with the sword. You can now go up the ladder safely.<br /> At the top turn right, go to the edge of the wall and down the ladder there.<br />At the bottom, go left to the large gap and store your sword. Jump off the edge<br />and land above where you picked up the torch.<br /> Make sure that the line under the stored objects is under the sword before<br />jumping off to the right.<br /> Recover the sword and kill the guards (beware, they move quickly), then<br />collect the aqualung on the left of the screen.<br /> Hold the aqualung in your hands, and jump off the edge, where you first landed<br />in the water. Go up the ladder on your left and make your way to the pillar<br />where you collected the first torch.<br /> Jump off the edge, and when you are over the bucket press P. Make sure you<br />still have the aqualung in your hands, put the line under the bucket and while<br />you are still in the water press D, R, S, and P in that order. The bucket is<br />now filled.<br /> Go back to where you left the torches and use them as described above to catch<br />the red men. Let them into the spiders' area but this time go to the left hand<br />side and through the wall.<br /> Go down the stairs and across the gaps, recover the bucket ready for the witch<br />and when she is close, throw the water to kill her.<br /> Keep going left for the gap with the wand in it. Leaving the sword at the top,<br />jump into the gap, pick up the wand and store it. Next recover the stool and<br />use it to get out and pick up the sword again.<br /> Move left and climb the next ladder. Recover the aqualung and follow the path<br />past the coin into the water. Climb the ladder to your left and go towards the<br />Troll's bridge.<br /> Descend the ladder before the bridge and jump the two gaps to the other side.<br />Go down the ladder here and kill the two yellow guards with the sword. Move<br />right, but don't go up the ladder or into the water. Finally, recover the wand<br />and throw it right (at the wall) to reveal the Treasure.<br /><br />    </td></tr></table>
