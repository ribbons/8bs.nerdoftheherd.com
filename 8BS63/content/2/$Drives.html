Someone emailed me with a problem they were having with their disc drives.<br />My reply is worth repeating here as it may be of use to some of you.<br /><br />Dave....<br />> I think I put a damaged disk in there ... made a horrible screeching sound<br />> .... and kaput.  It doesn't read anything now *sob*  Does this sound like a<br />> head cleaning problem?  Is cleaning the heads an easy job?<br /><br />My reply...<br />Must not speak too soon of course, but if you think it was caused by a grotty<br />disc, you are not on your own. I have been sent a few bad discs in my time and<br />they have caused me problems. I always check discs before sticking them in my<br />drives, but occasionally a disc with tobacco or other such nasties like hair<br />gets through the check and into the drive.<br /><br />What  I have is a large selection of 'throw away discs'. When I hear an unusual<br />sound coming from my drive I will immediately remove the disc and sling it<br />(after looking at the surfaces to see which side is affected, sometimes the<br />surface is scratched. I then put in a 'throw away disc' and see if it makes<br />the same sound (indicating a foreign body stuck in the drive). In this case an<br />immediate dismantling of the drive is the best option. If not, and the drive<br />is read/writing discs, I then carry on tentatively where I left off.<br /><br />If the drive is not read/writing, the next stage is to clean the heads. If I<br />am in a hurry, I use a head cleaning disc. If not, I dismantle the drive.<br /><br />Dismantling the drive is not as hairy as it sounds. Usually there are only a<br />couple of screws holding it together. The old screwdriver soon has them out.<br />Sometimes there may be a metal plate over the drive. This has to come off. The<br />heads are located on arms in the centre of the drive. Usually the top head will<br />lift up enough for you to get a cotton bud soaked in Isopropyl Alcohol (ask<br />your chemist, they may ask you what you want it for, whatever you do, don't<br />tell them you are going to drink it!). If necessary, give it a good rub. I<br />have often used a lot of force on heads that seemed hopeless, so it didn't<br />matter, it doesn't seem to have done any harm. The head is a piece of what<br />looks like ceramic material with a slot containing the gubbins set into it.<br /><br />Once or twice I have had heads that were literally stuck together and required<br />real force to clean them, they eventually became servicable.<br /><br />Best of luck!<br /><br />Chris<br />    </td></tr></table>
