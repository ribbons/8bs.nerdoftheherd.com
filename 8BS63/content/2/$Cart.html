Spare Master Cartridge news<br />===========================<br />As promised some time ago I have been looking into the possibility of <br />restarting fabrication of Master cartridges.<br /><br />Having phoned round several PCB manufacturers (since this is where the <br />majority of the expenses go) I have found that these could be made at a cost<br />of `9.50 each.<br /><br />Note that these do not include the beige plastic cases though.<br /><br />The boards would be double sided,ready assembled and checked.Each with a unique<br />id number and 1 year warranty.<br /><br />Now for the bad news - the minimum order quantity from the PCB manufacturer<br />is 50 boards.Some simple maths reveals that this is about `500 outlay for me,<br />which I can't afford.So,orders must be accompanied by a `5 per board deposit.<br /><br />Please indicate AS SOON AS POSSIBLE how many you all might be interested in<br />buying.If the result is less than 50 then sorry,but it wont go ahead.If more<br />than 50 boards are needed then I shall request the deposits from you and<br />send for the boards.I have been quoted 14-16 days for them to be made.<br /><br />A preprepared box is below,should you want to print this (80 column mode only)<br /><br />+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+<br />!                                                                            !<br />!
