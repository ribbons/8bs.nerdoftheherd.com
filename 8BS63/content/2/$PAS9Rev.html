<br /><br />                               Play It Again Sam 9 Review<br />                                 By Crispin Boylan (E4W)<br /><br /><br />Title: Play It Again Sam 9<br /><br />Available From: Superior Software<br /><br />Price: `11.95 (`6 for 8BS members)<br /><br />Type of Game:<br /><br />Four games In Compilation:<br /><br />Spycat: Graphical Adventure<br />Camelot: Arcade Adventure<br />The Life Of Repton: Action puzzle/strategy<br />Steve Davis Snooker: Sports<br /><br />Well, I'm back again for the umpteenth time, and this time it is Play It Again<br />Sam 9 which has fallen into my clutches...<br /><br />There are four games on this compilation, so I will review each one separately.<br />I will start with probably the funniest Superior Software Game I've ever<br />played, Spycat.<br /><br />Spycat<br />------<br /><br />You are Spycat, a member of the covert branch of law enforcement, MI4.5, and<br />after 50 years loyal service you have been retired from duties, with an<br />extremely small pension.  Therefore, as any loyal spy would do, you have<br />decided to steal the three secret documents and retire to Greenland to write<br />your memoirs.<br /><br />The basic game is very much in the mould of Citadel, Castle Quest and all those<br />other great favourites on the beeb, in that you as the central character have<br />to go around solving visual puzzles and using the right objects in the right<br />places.  There is also a bit of enemy negotiating to be done, as you have to<br />escape from the mad machines of Doctor 'Q', cunningly named Clive Amstrad!  The<br />controls are more complexed in this game from previous games in the same genre,<br />in that you have a six button panel which is operated with the cursor keys,<br />this can be used to pick up and drop objects, use them, enter doors, and<br />control the sound.  Whilst this may seem a good idea in practice it is somewhat<br />fiddly to be controlling the character with the Z,X,: and / keys, whilst<br />simultaneously controlling this panel.  It is lucky then that this game does<br />not require a great deal of fast movements.<br /><br />The graphics in the game are very smartly presented, in the Mode 2 screen,<br />which gives a nice palette of colours to display, and also allows fast flowing<br />graphics.  The animation on this game is simply the best I have ever seen in a<br />game of this type, one of the nicest touches is the fact that the character<br />does not simply flip over when you want him to move the other way, but actually<br />turns, it is simple but makes the game a lot more attractive.  The game does<br />not suffer from the dreaded flicker that animated objects in some games do.<br /><br />The gameplay is exciting and fun, the whole Spy genre has a lot of room in it<br />for a good game, and also provides a few laughs along the way.  It is also<br />difficult, but not so much that you feel frustrated.  The only bad thing about<br />this game is the sound, it is hardly inventive, merely functional.  Not a bad<br />attempt from the masters of this genre really!<br /><br />Camelot<br />-------<br /><br />It may seem a bit foolish to put two games which do not seem all that different<br />on the same compilation, but once you get into it, this game actually differs<br />quite a lot from Spycat.  For one thing, it focuses a lot more on the Arcade<br />side of the Adventure genre, really the thinking mans shoot-em-up to put it<br />bluntly.  The plot of this game is a bit thin on the ground, but it goes like<br />this: you have been thrown out of the kingdom of Camelot, for generally being a<br />bit of a bad king, and you have to convince the people of the kingdom that you<br />are indeed a worthy ruler.  So, as is usually the best way to prove you are a<br />bit tough, you have to kill things and find things, and basically be a bit of a<br />royal bully!<br /><br />The objective of the game is to gain 3000 points, most of this will come from<br />the six bags of gold which give you 450 points each, and also from shooting and<br />killing the various enemies which lie in wait for you around the castle.  There<br />are witches and soldiers, witches are harder to kill but gain more points.  You<br />can also cast spells, which are strewn about the castle, and these produce<br />various effects.  There are also various objects, such as keys to be collected,<br />there are 5 of these.  To make the game harder you have a time limit, and a<br />limited amount of energy, a certain amount of this is lost every time you fire.<br />The game is quite large, and although not as difficult puzzle-wise as some of<br />the more famous games such as Citadel or Castle Quest, it is certainly a<br />challenge.<br /><br />The graphics are good in this game, with some high res mode 4 graphics.  These<br />produce a nice overall effect, it is a wonder that the author (Tony Oakden, of<br />Quest and Star Port fame) managed to fit all of them in as aswell as some of<br />the tasks you have to accomplish!  The colours used in the game are nice and<br />bright, and don't clash, but the animation is not really up to the standard of<br />the aforementioned Spycat.  Sound in this game is a replica of Tony Oakdens<br />other two games, beeps in appropriate places, no music, but still you can't<br />expect everything!<br /><br />The gameplay is just what the doctor ordered if you are into the shoot-em-up<br />and adventure genres, if you have problems with the puzzles on dedicated puzzle<br />and adventure games, then this is the game for you.<br /><br />Steve Davis Snooker<br />-------------------<br /><br />Created back in the days when the record collecting cue master was at his peak,<br />Steve Davis snooker was probably one of the first licensed games ever.  Now<br />however, Steve is well past his best, and this game can bring you all the<br />satisfaction of playing against the real person, it certainly does have a high<br />level of intelligence.  Playing alone against Steve, or with another Human<br />player, you basically have to beat your opponent at snooker.  Standard snooker<br />rules apply, with fouls and replays all included.<br /><br />The game is certainly very hard against the computer, and I think the control<br />system could have been improved a bit.  For example, in stead of a length<br />adjustable line which is pointed in the direction you want the ball to go, all<br />you get is a cross hairs which you place on the screen in the direction you<br />want it to go.  This makes it a lot harder to line up the shots, and frequently<br />results in the cue ball missing the coloured balls all together!<br /><br />The graphics in this game are to be frank, quite dull, and not very interesting<br />at all.  Instead of green you get a black baize, the black ball is really a<br />white unfilled circle, and the brown ball is a red ball with a green circle<br />around it.  Perhaps they could have used shading?  Another fault of the game is<br />that when you hit the ball with maximum power, as the cue ball strikes the<br />target ball, it sometimes takes a while for it to register.  This sometimes<br />looks very fake and disappointing.<br /><br />So, not a hugely brilliant game, but then again licensed games never have been<br />known for their outstanding success.  Not surprisingly this is the only game<br />that has not actually been written by Superior themselves, but by CDS Software.<br /><br />The Life Of Repton<br />------------------<br /><br />In the fifth of the seven Repton games, you have to play through 40 screens,<br />five specific areas each with 8 screens.  These are really just new levels and<br />graphics sets for the original Repton 3, but they are interesting nonetheless.<br />You have Baby Repton, Schoolboy Repton, Teenage Repton, Work Repton and OAP<br />Repton.  This provides a nice variation in the graphics every 8 levels which is<br />just what is needed.  The game also features the often praised game editor,<br />which allows you to create many levels for the game, which you can either play<br />yourself or give to your friends (or maybe enter in a Repton competition?!) The<br />best thing about the editor is that you can design whatever you want about the<br />game, right down to each individual graphics picture.<br /><br />The gameplay is the same as it has been since Repton 3, this is very varied,<br />and there are many different puzzles which can be completed.  Dodging through<br />rocks, collecting keys to turn safes into diamonds, guiding Spirits to their<br />cages to turn them into diamonds, killing monsters.  It is all in there, and<br />very interesting and thought provoking to play.  In addition to collecting all<br />the diamonds on the level, you have to collect the Crown, and diffuse the timb<br />bomb (all you have to do their is after collecting all the diamonds and the<br />crown, walk over it) there is a time limit, which can be extended with the<br />time-capsules.  In addition to the monsters and spirits, another enemy is the<br />Fungus, this is a special type of square, which spreads over the screen and<br />blocks off objects.  It is essential to stop this from spreading by surrounding<br />it with rocks, or it will block off a diamond!  This is all great fun, and one<br />of the best gameplay ideas ever.<br /><br />The graphics in this game are up to the usual standards of the games with nice<br />fast graphics, and very colourful and detailed sprites.  The different graphics<br />sets give a good wide range of different graphics, so you never get fed up of<br />staring at the same graphics.  The sound is the usual Repton tune, which is<br />good but annoying after a while.  The only minor gripe is that the ting of<br />collecting the diamonds is very high pitched, luckily this can be turned off<br />though!<br /><br />Overall Score For PIAS 9<br />------------------------<br />88% - Definitely one of the best compilations in the series, it has a mixture<br />of games, and only one of them won't be on the screen regularly.  For four<br />quality games, this would be cheap at twice the price.<br />    </td></tr></table>
