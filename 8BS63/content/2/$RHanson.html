<br />Interview: The Superior Software Years and the Future<br /><br /><br /><br />Richard Hanson was interviewed<br />by Crispin Boylan (E4W) during Easter 1998.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />--<br />Thank you for agreeing to this interview. Will you begin by telling me how you<br />first got involved with computers and software? <br /><br /><br />>From my youth I've been interested in mathematics and computers, and I decided<br />to take a B.Sc. degree in Mathematics at the University of Leeds. Home<br />computers were just starting to become available at that time; they were<br />relatively expensive and very limited by today's standards. I gradually became<br />more interested in computers, and switched degree course in my first-year at<br />university to a B.Sc. in Computational Science. <br /><br />The university courses provided a wide knowledge of programming techniques and<br />methods. That knowledge later proved to be very useful to me in many ways when<br />I was running Superior Software. <br /><br />While I was at university I bought my first home computer, an Acorn Atom, which<br />was the forerunner to Acorn's BBC Microcomputer. I wrote some games and other<br />software for the Acorn Atom using Basic and a 6502 assembler, and 17 of my<br />games and utilities were published by a Leeds-based software publisher called<br />Program Power, which subsequently became known as Micro Power. Later I bought<br />one of the first BBC Micros and wrote some games and utility software for that<br />computer. <br /><br /><br /><br />--<br />When did you form Superior Software, and what made you decide to get into the<br />business? <br /><br /><br />I formed Superior Software in the summer of 1982 after completing my degree,<br />and my first business partner was another graduate, John Dyson, who worked for<br />the BBC in Leeds. I decided to set up in business because the software that I'd<br />written for Micro Power had been commercially successful, and I felt confident<br />that I would be able to manage the other aspects involved in running the<br />business. <br /><br /><br /><br />------<br />How did you go about setting up Superior Software and getting games for the new<br />company? What was the initial reaction when Superior Software emerged into the<br />BBC Micro marketplace? <br /><br /><br />Superior Software's first four games were published in the autumn of 1982; I<br />wrote three of those games, and John Dyson wrote the other one. We set up<br />Superior Software with just £100 - John and I each put £50 into a company bank<br />account; and we placed a small black-and-white advertisement in one of the<br />early home computer magazines - I think our first advertisement appeared in a<br />magazine called Computing Today. All of our initial software was sold on<br />cassette because very few BBC Micro owners had disk drives in those days. Apart<br />from the cost of our computers, which we would have bought anyway, £100 was the<br />most money that we would lose from the Superior Software venture if it had not<br />worked out. <br /><br />Anyway we received a very good response to our first advertisement, and the<br />software sales which it generated covered the cost of the advertisement several<br />times over. We started to place larger advertisements in a few magazines, and<br />invited other programmers to send their software to us for evaluation and<br />possible marketing by us. <br /><br /><br /><br />-<br />Who thought of the name Superior Software? <br /><br /><br />That was my idea. Some key considerations for brandnames are memorability,<br />snappiness and alliteration: Superior Software gave us a golden identity, and<br />something to live up to. I've sometimes said that I might have chosen another<br />name, but all in all I'm happy with that choice. <br /><br /><br />------<br />What was the first major success that Superior Software had? What were your<br />feelings when it happened? <br /><br /><br />Our first big success came in the autumn of 1983, when we received some large<br />distributor orders for about 10 of our games. I was very pleased and relieved<br />by this success; a great deal of hard work had gone into building the company<br />up to reach this stage. <br /><br />By that time John Dyson had left the company because he enjoyed his work for<br />the BBC and didn't want to join Superior Software on a full-time basis. Steve<br />Botterill, a friend from schooldays, joined me before John Dyson left. <br /><br /><br /><br />In the early days, who were your main competitors? How did you get on with your<br />competitors? <br /><br /><br />Our main competitors in the early days were Acornsoft and Micro Power, and both<br />of those companies produced some technically accomplished games. Another<br />software publisher that came on the scene with some very good games was a<br />company called Software Invasion. Those four companies pushed against the<br />technical capabilities of the BBC Micro, and each company would regularly bring<br />out new landmark games. <br /><br />I didn't see very much of the Acornsoft management at that time, but I<br />occasionally met the Micro Power and Software Invasion management, and<br />everything was quite convivial. Although the four companies were in<br />competition, we didn't abuse the professional relationships. <br /><br />In particular, I've always got on well with Bob Simpson, the Managing Director<br />of Micro Power, and we've shared a mutual respect for one another. Bob was one<br />of the first people in the UK to appreciate that home computer software was<br />going to become a very big profitable industry. As I mentioned earlier in the<br />interview, I had written some game and utilities for the Acorn Atom which Micro<br />Power marketed while I was at university. I then wrote a further six games and<br />utilities for the BBC Micro when it first appeared and I offered those to Micro<br />Power for marketing. Shortly afterwards, I decided that I would set up my own<br />business. When I told Bob Simpson about this, he asked me whether Micro Power<br />could still publish the six titles that I had submitted to him. There had been<br />no agreements signed for them at that stage, and the those six titles would<br />have been a tremendous start for Superior Software, but I told Bob that he<br />could publish them. So our first conversation as competitors was gentlemanly,<br />and that's how our relationship continued. A few years later Bob said to me: "I<br />take my hat off to you," after Superior Software had surpassed Micro Power on<br />the software publishing front. It was a very kind compliment. <br /><br /><br /><br />------<br />When was it that you first realised how much of a popularity Superior Software<br />had with BBC Micro owners, and how was that popularity reflected in Superior<br />Software's overall chart performances? <br /><br /><br />Well, from the beginning I'm pleased to say that we've received many<br />complimentary letters from customers and it soon became clear that people<br />appreciated our software. All the same it was good to see that confirmed by the<br />software charts. Gallup produced a weekly software chart, and one memorable<br />week in January 1987 Superior Software's games were placed at positions 1, 2, 3<br />and 9 in the BBC Micro software chart; the top slot was filled by Repton 3,<br />which held the number 1 position for 12 weeks, finally being overtaken by<br />Ravenskull. <br /><br />At the start of May 1987, Superior Software's titles occupied all of the top 5<br />positions in the chart: <br /><br /><br />BBC Micro Software Top 10<br />2nd May 1987<br />1  Grand Prix Construction Set - Superior Software<br />2  Ravenskull - Superior Software<br />3  Stryker's Run - Superior Software<br />4  Superior Collection Volume 2 - Superior Software<br />5  Superior Collection Volume 1 - Superior Software<br />6  Cholo - Firebird<br />7  Micro Power MagicMicro Power<br />8  Repton 3 - Superior Software<br />9  Mini Office 2 - Database<br />10 Winter Olympics - Tynesoft<br /><br /><br />So it was evident that Superior Software games were very popular with BBC Micro<br />owners, and we were very grateful for their continued support. <br /><br /><br /><br />----<br />Why do you think that Superior Software has been so successful and has lasted<br />so long? Do you think it is due to the way in which it has been run, the games<br />it has produced, or some over reason? <br /><br />I think there are several reasons: <br /><br />Primarily it has been teamwork. Apart from me, there are literally hundreds of<br />other people who have contributed to Superior Software's success in some way.<br /><br />The quality of our software, including attention to detail in the software, has<br />always been of great importance. We had to reject many submitted games and<br />utilities that didn't reach a high enough standard, and our software has always<br />been carefully checked prior to release. A bug would rarely creep through the<br />net, and comparatively our overall record is very good. <br /><br />Customer service has also been a key feature for Superior Software. For<br />example, I knew from my own experience that when I ordered an item by<br />mail-order I didn't want to have to wait three or four weeks before I received<br />the item. So we have always prided ourselves on despatching orders promptly,<br />and usually we have been able to despatch our software on the same day that it<br />was ordered by a customer. <br /><br />Respect for our customers is also important. When I first started in this<br />business, I remember visiting another software company where the Managing<br />Director forthrightly told me that they had advertised some software for a<br />newly-released computer, and those advertisements had appeared in the computer<br />magazines before the software company had even received the new computer let<br />alone written any software for it. It was a kind of scam against their<br />customers; I'm not implying that they didn't publish the advertised game - they<br />did, but months after their advertisements had first appeared in the computer<br />magazines. We have never used those kind of practices. Of course they may bring<br />short-term financial gains, but they also tend to generate long-term customer<br />resentment. <br /><br />Integrity and honesty are major factors, particularly where financial<br />transactions are involved. We've always paid invoices promptly, and Superior<br />Software has never had an overdraft at any stage during its existence. We've<br />particularly prided ourselves on our fair dealings with our computer<br />programmers; we had programmers dotted all around the country with most of our<br />programmers working from home, so it was very important to them that they were<br />dealing with a company they could trust. <br /><br />I asked a few of our programmers whether they would give me some feedback that<br />I could put in a new programmer recruitment advertisement in 1987. We included<br />some programmers' comments in that advertisement, including this one from Chris<br />Roberts, one of our programmers who later went on to manage his own software<br />company in the USA: "I used to work for another software house, and I never got<br />to speak to any of the directors nor anyone with any major influence within the<br />company. At Superior Software, I deal directly with the Managing Director.<br />Perhaps more importantly, just six weeks after the release of Stryker's Run I<br />received my first royalty cheque which amounted to more than £5000, whereas<br />obtaining my royalties due from the other company was like getting blood out of<br />a stone; it took several months of nagging and chasing before they paid me the<br />money they owed me." <br /><br />That was a familiar story which I'd heard from many other programmers; my first<br />business partner John Dyson had been ripped off by that same software company.<br />Right from the start, we resolved to pay royalties promptly and treat everyone<br />with fairness and integrity. <br /><br /><br /><br />----<br />In answering my previous question, you said that teamwork has been a prime<br />factor in the company's success. Will you tell me about some of the people who<br />have been on the Superior Software team? <br /><br /><br /><br />Yes, I would like to acknowledge and thank everyone who has played a part in<br />Superior Software's success: <br /><br />First and foremost, my parents have been major influences in many respects. My<br />father, who sadly died last year, was always very encouraging and showed by<br />example the benefits that honesty and integrity generate; that applies to life<br />generally of course, not just to business. My mother has helped in many<br />practical ways, including testing some of the early games, and has demonstrated<br />again by example the importance of good financial management. They were very<br />pleased and supportive when I steered Superior Software within five years from<br />nothing to a business approaching a £1 million turnover. <br /><br />John Dyson wrote three of our early games, and his parents allowed their home<br />to be used as Superior Software's first business venue and trading address. <br /><br />Steve Botterill played a major role in two spells of employment with Superior<br />Software. One aspect is that he showed good skill at implementation; to put it<br />in a nutshell, Steve got things done. <br /><br />Chris Payne worked with me as a Marketing Manager, and his knowledge of<br />marketing - he has a degree in the subject - assisted Superior Software to grow<br />rapidly from a small company to a much larger one. In terms of the company's<br />financial progress, his knowledge was an enormous contribution. <br /><br />Mike Ellis was responsible for the artwork and design elements in Superior<br />Software's packaging and advertising. In working with him over many years, one<br />particular attribute has been his great reliability - even when he was working<br />to some very tight deadlines that I gave him. <br /><br />One of my brothers, Steven Hanson, has run Superior Software during its later<br />years, and he has kept up the company's traditions of software reliability and<br />good customer relations. Partly due to cutting the overheads, Superior Software<br />has survived longer than the vast majority of companies in this field. Steven<br />was very supportive to me in the early years while I was building up the<br />company. <br /><br />Considering computer programmers, games developers, company staff and other<br />workers, there are so many that have played a part in Superior Software's<br />success. Again I'd like to thank all of them, and I'll mention some of the key<br />players: <br /><br />Peter Scott was a prolific and very skilful programmer, writing games such as<br />Superior Soccer, and our conversions of Sim City and Ballistix. Another<br />prolific author, Peter Johnson, wrote Overdrive, Space Pilot, Deathstar and six<br />other games. Tim Tyler wrote Repton and Repton 2, and designed some of the<br />levels for Repton 3. David Braben, Ian Bell, Kevin Edwards, David Hoskins,<br />Peter Irvin, Jeremy Smith, Jonathan Griffiths, Martin Edmondson, Richard Kay,<br />Matthew Atkinson, Tony Oakden, David Lawrence, David Acton, Ian Holmes, William<br />Reeve, Chris Roberts, Gary Partis, Nick Pelling, Graham Stanley, John Wallace,<br />Adrian Stephens, James Woodhouse, Mark Botterill and Rob Northern have all put<br />in substantial work on the development of Superior Software's titles. <br /><br />Two names which may not be well known to our customers are Chris Hart and Dave<br />Carlos, both of whom have been important to Superior Software's success. Chris<br />Hart ensured that our software worked across the entire range of BBC Micro and<br />Acorn Electron computers; that was sometimes a very complex task, but Chris<br />handled it with tremendous skill and alacrity. Dave Carlos has contributed in<br />many ways in areas as diverse as software copy protection and product<br />marketing. <br /><br /><br /><br />------<br />In 1986 Superior Software obtained the rights to republish some of Acornsoft<br />games. What was the main thinking behind that: were you looking for another<br />name to consolidate Superior Software's market position, or were you motivated<br />by lucrative Acornsoft games, such as Elite? With hindsight do you wish you had<br />published Elite originally? <br /><br /><br />Acorn Computers approached Superior Software and some other software companies<br />in 1986 because Acorn largely wanted to concentrate its activities on hardware<br />rather than software. The Acornsoft label and software were worth obtaining for<br />two main reasons: (a) Acornsoft and Acorn Computers were implicitly associated<br />with the BBC Micro as manufacturers of the computer, and (b) Acornsoft had<br />produced some very good software such as Elite, Revs, and some of their early<br />games. <br /><br />The Acornsoft contract could easily have gone to one of our competitors, and I<br />felt it was very important that we gained this contract, so I designed a<br />detailed and sophisticated business plan which we presented to Acorn. They<br />decided to award the contract to us - however there was a potential difficulty:<br />originally Acorn wanted us to republish most of their extensive range of games<br />software. I thought that this would be detrimental to both parties because<br />although Acornsoft had published some top-selling games, they had also<br />published some fairly esoteric minority-market software as well. We talked this<br />over, and eventually it was agreed that Superior Software would republish<br />Acornsoft's most popular games. <br /><br />Regarding David Braben and Ian Bell, the co-authors of Elite: I would have been<br />delighted to have published Elite when it first appeared in 1984. However, at<br />that stage Superior Software had not risen to great prominence, so<br />understandably David and Ian did not originally offer the game to us. I was<br />pleased to republish Elite under the joint Superior Software / Acornsoft label<br />in 1986, and we achieved good sales figures for the game in its re-released<br />form. David and Ian created a top quality game, and have deservedly earned a<br />considerable amount of money from Elite, which has been published by several<br />companies in many computer and console formats. <br /><br /><br />------<br />How many games and other software titles have Superior Software published in<br />total? <br /><br />We've published over 100 games and utilities of our own, and we've republished<br />about 40 of the best games originally published by other companies. <br /><br /><br /><br />-----<br />What have been Superior Software's top-selling titles? <br /><br />The Repton range of games has been the biggest selling series for us. There<br />were seven BBC Micro titles in the Repton series, and the cumulative sales are<br />over 125,000 units. <br /><br />After the initial success of Repton, our customers were repeatedly asking us<br />for more so we kept producing Repton sequels. I still receive enquiries from<br />people asking whether there will be any more Repton games. I know you want to<br />discuss some of my future plans later in the interview, so I'll come back to<br />that subject. <br /><br />I think Repton is the kind of game that appeals to many people who would not<br />usually play computer games; it's a brain teaser rather than being one of those<br />games that just require dexterity and quick reactions. <br /><br />Away from games, our software-based speech synthesiser called SPEECH! was a big<br />success, and a rewarding technical accomplishment for us. It also gave us our<br />first major television exposure, when SPEECH! received a glowing review by Fred<br />Harris on BBC TV's Saturday Superstore programme. It's always very gratifying<br />to receive that kind of unbiased praise for our software. <br /><br />There were about 50 other titles which achieved good sales figures, including<br />Elite, Overdrive, Tempest, Citadel, Karate Combat, Thrust, Galaforce,<br />Ravenskull, Stryker's Run, Crazee Rider, The Last Ninja, Predator, Ballistix,<br />Sim City, Revs, Quest, Spycat, Exile, Superior Soccer, Ricochet, and<br />Perplexity. <br /><br /><br /><br />-----<br />You mentioned The Last Ninja. That game was originally published by Activision<br />for other computers, and it was one of several games which Superior Software<br />published for the BBC Micro after the original version had been published by<br />another company. Was that your idea, or did another company approach Superior<br />Software with that idea? What was the thinking behind those business<br />arrangements? <br /><br /><br /><br />It was my idea. It was becoming increasing difficult for other companies to<br />publish BBC Micro games because the companies needed to have considerable<br />knowledge of the compatibility issues surrounding the BBC Micro. There were<br />four major versions of BBC Micro available - the BBC B, the BBC B+, the BBC<br />Master, and the BBC Master Compact - together with the related Acorn Electron<br />co<br />mputer. Not only that, but Acorn had produced several different versions of<br />the BBC Micro operating system and two versions of BBC Basic, which was often<br />used as a shell for some of the games. So it was often a complicated task to<br />ensure that a new BBC Micro game would function correctly across that whole<br />range of computers and operating systems. <br /><br />I looked at some of the successful games that had been published for other<br />computers, and we started to contact those publishers to ask if they would like<br />us to create BBC Micro and Acorn Electron versions of their games. We offered<br />to pay them royalties or an outright payment, and not surprisingly most of the<br />companies we approached were agreeable as it provided them with extra income<br />and entailed very little extra work for them. It was a good symbiotic<br />relationship in commercial terms because they received payments from us, while<br />we obtained rights to some well known games that had already achieved<br />prominence due to the marketing of the other versions of the games. <br /><br /><br /><br />--<br />In my opinion Exile is the best BBC Micro game ever published. How did you make<br />it so good? <br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you. Exile is certainly a brilliant piece of programming work, and the<br />game's two programmers, Peter Irvin and Jeremy Smith, must take most of the<br />credit for that. Separately they had previously written Starship Command and<br />Thrust respectively; as very experienced programmers they seemed to be able to<br />take the BBC Micro right to the edge of its capabilities. <br /><br />Many of the games, including Exile, had prize competitions for players who<br />completed challenges in the games. Whose idea was it to have prize competitions<br />associated with some of Superior Software's games, and were those prizes always<br />awarded? <br /><br />That was one of Chris Payne's promotional ideas. Some of the prizes were quite<br />substantial; for example, a £500 sports moped was the first prize in our Crazee<br />Rider game; and I'm sure the prize competition was a very worthwhile<br />promotional feature for our major games. Yes, we always awarded the prizes that<br />we described, and we were careful to deter cheating by using mechanisms such as<br />encoding messages within the games. <br /><br /><br /><br />-------<br />What is your favourite Superior Software game, excluding those games that had<br />originally been published by other companies? <br /><br /><br />It is definitely one of the Repton games, although it's hard to say which one I<br />prefer; if I have to choose just one, I'll go for Repton 3. <br /><br /><br /><br />-<br />Do you still own and play any of the old Superior Software games? <br /><br /><br />I think I have all of our published games, plus a few that didn't make it to<br />publication. An unusual game called Jeremy Goes Jumping is probably the one<br />that was closest to publication, but it didn't quite make the grade. A few<br />people have seen a basic demonstration version of a Peter Johnson game called<br />VTOL; in fact, VTOL only exists in demonstration form because the game itself<br />was abandoned before completion. I occasionally play some of the old games,<br />particularly when friends ask to see the games. <br /><br /><br /><br />There are plenty of humourous touches in some of the Superior Software games.<br />Which game do you think is the most amusing game among those you have seen from<br />Superior Software and other companies? <br /><br />That's not so easy to answer. Many of the Superior Software games have comical<br />elements, such as the monkeys in Exile, and some of the scenarios in Spycat. <br /><br />Of course a game doesn't need to be complex to be absorbing and fun-to-play.<br />For example, Micro Power published a little game called Sheepdog for the Nascom<br />computer, which was one of the earliest home computers in the UK. Bob Simpson<br />showed me the game and invited me to produce an Acorn Atom version of the game,<br />and I agreed. The Acorn Atom version had to be simple too because: (a) for<br />speed of conversion I was writing the game in Basic, and (b) the Acorn Atom was<br />quite limited in its capabilities - its output was fundamentally<br />black-and-white and sounds were restricted to a single simple tone generator.<br />Although Sheepdog was quite basic, nevertheless it was a humourous and<br />sometimes challenging game. <br /><br />The same applies to Repton in comparison with some of the recent<br />graphically-advanced software that is available for the games consoles.<br />Computers and games consoles have certainly leapt forward in terms of the<br />graphical capabilities, but that factor alone doesn't lead to the games being<br />more fun to play. Speaking again of Repton, that's a game that frequently<br />creates a lot of laughter; some of the alternative ideas which we devised for<br />the Repton sequels, such as Repton Thru Time, are often greeted with<br />incredulity when the player meets them for the first time. <br /><br />I don't know which is the most amusing game I've seen; there are so many games<br />that can make people laugh at times. Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers and<br />Psygnosis's Lemmings are definitely contenders. <br /><br /><br /><br />-<br />Do you long for the Superior Software days of old, or just want to forget them?<br /><br /><br />Those days were often enjoyable, and sometimes very challenging as well. I'm<br />happy with the software we published: some of our games continue to be played<br />today, and I think Elite and Repton will still be enjoyed in 100 years' time. <br /><br />While I'm sure I'll never forget some of the significant moments, I'm now<br />looking forward to new challenges. <br /><br /><br />-<br />As a computer, how do you rate the BBC Micro compared to the PC of today - I<br />don't mean in terms of power, but as a development medium? How much of a<br />following do you think the BBC Micro still has? <br /><br />One of the virtues of the BBC Micro is that it is relatively easy for novices<br />to use for creating some software of their own. The manual supplied with the<br />BBC Micro explains initial steps in programming, and it's clearly written.<br />Immediately a beginner can type in a few lines of Basic and write a real<br />program - a simple program perhaps, but nevertheless a start. <br /><br />The PC has gradually improved over the years, and Windows 95 was a major and<br />much-needed step forward in my view. In terms of software development, I think<br />the choice depends on the particular software which is being developed. Clearly<br />the BBC Micro now has some limitations compared to modern PCs, but it remains a<br />very useful learning base. <br /><br />There are still a substantial number of people who, at least occasionally, use<br />their BBC Micros for games or programming. Some people have suggested that the<br />appeal of the early home computers will be sustained and possibly increase,<br />partly for nostalgic reasons. That may well be so; there seems to be a great<br />deal of nostalgia around, and the "progress" of recent years has surely had its<br />drawbacks as well as its benefits. <br /><br /><br /><br />--<br />How do you think the software games industry has changed since Superior<br />Software's heyday? <br /><br /><br /><br />Clearly the graphics, sound and processing capabilities of the computers and<br />consoles have increased by leaps and bounds, although the games themselves are<br />not necessarily more enjoyable or challenging purely because of that. There are<br />definitely some very good new games around, but many games seem to be re-worked<br />versions of old ideas. Considerably more money is often spent on the<br />development and marketing of new games nowadays. <br /><br />The graphics in recent games are visually more realistic and lifelike, and that<br />factor brings with it greater responsibilities for the games producers and<br />publishers. For example, it's now possible to depict seemingly very lifelike<br />human torture scenes and massacres in computer and console games. The<br />responsibilities of games producers are similar to the kind of responsibilities<br />that film producers have, but perhaps games producers face more complex<br />decisions because games involve greater interaction. Usually the viewers of a<br />film cannot affect the storyline and scenes of the film they are watching; but<br />computer game players are able to interact with the programs, so a computer<br />game can approach reality in a way that a film cannot. Computer game players<br />may sometimes get close to feeling those real emotions they would experience if<br />they were actually killing another human being. <br /><br />It's all a question of balance of course. I remember a few years ago an MP<br />proposed that the Tom & Jerry cartoons were unfit for children to see because<br />of some of the violent scenes in the cartoons. Well, I think the vast majority<br />of people, including children, can fairly readily appreciate the difference<br />between real violence and cartoon violence, so I don't tend to agree with that<br />MP's view. However, some modern computer graphics are photo-realistic and often<br />depict humans rather than imaginary cartoon-style characters. It's been said<br />that dramatic films simply mirror society, but there have been some extreme<br />films that have shown entirely fictional gross acts of torture created by the<br />scriptwriter's mind, and dramatic licence used in films sometimes effectively<br />distorts by focusing on the specific without regard for the whole. Major film<br />producers have the power to insidiously affect society as well as just<br />mirroring society; that power, and the responsibility which it engenders, is<br />increasingly being put in the hands of games producers now. <br /><br /><br />---<br /><br />Would you describe your major strength and major weakness as a businessman? <br /><br /><br />That's the kind of question that is often used in job interviews nowadays.<br />Well, I'll do my best to give you a straightforward reply: <br /><br />I have a good analytical and financial business brain; I'm a very good<br />financial manager. The logical, analytical reasoning required to construct<br />complex computer programs frequently comes in useful to enable me to quickly<br />analyse day-to-day business situations and make good financial decisions. <br /><br />My major weakness is that I have sometimes been too soft with people on<br />occasions when it would have been preferable to have exerted my authority<br />instead. <br /><br /><br />Could you give me an example to illustrate those two aspects? <br /><br /><br />Well, an example comes to mind regarding Acorn Electron disk software, but it<br />would be churlish to go into detail because it involves a colleague who worked<br />with me at the time. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />What aspect has given you the greatest satisfaction while running Superior<br />Software? <br /><br /><br />The gratifying comments that we've received from customers about our software<br />and our service. The customers are always the final judges; and the<br />complimentary letters, phone calls and e-mail messages that we've received from<br />them over the years have been very rewarding. <br /><br />-------<br /><br />What forthcoming projects and ideas do you have? Will there be anything with a<br />Superior Software badge on it, or is your other company, Utopia Software, the<br />way forward for you? Can we expect to see a reunion Superior Software game for<br />the BBC Micro's 20th anniversary in 2001? <br /><br />In some respects a 20th anniversary game for the BBC Micro sounds appealing,<br />but the remaining BBC Micro software market is now very small. There may be<br />some possibilities in the area of BBC Micro emulation on the PC, although I<br />haven't yet seen a high quality, reliable, and easy-to-use emulator. If a<br />suitable emulator becomes available, that could represent a new way forward for<br />BBC Micro software. <br /><br />The good news for people who love Repton is that a PC conversion of Repton 3 is<br />in progress. At this stage I'm not sure when the conversion will be finished,<br />but I expect that all of the 144 levels from Repton 3 and the three sequels<br />will be made available. It's envisaged that the PC version of Repton 3 will<br />carry the Superior Software brandname, and I hope to be able to publish some<br />new levels, which would be our first new Repton 3 levels for 10 years. I should<br />stress that all of this is provisional, and depends upon the progress made by<br />the developer. I would be very interested to hear from anyone who might like to<br />be involved in designing some of the new Repton 3 levels, or programmers who<br />might be interested in converting other BBC Micro games into PC versions. To<br />contact me, my e-mail address is: richard@utopiasw.demon.co.uk <br /><br />I have plenty of ideas for other PC software products; first it will be<br />important to gauge the response that Repton 3 generates in its PC form. My<br />plans for Superior Software and Utopia Software mainly revolve around the PC<br />and the Internet now, although of course I will always have a soft spot for the<br />BBC Micro. <br /><br /><br />------<br /><br />Finally, what would you say to budding entrepreneurs who are thinking of<br />setting up their own businesses? <br /><br />There are some comments I can make based upon my own experiences: <br /><br />1.Before you get involved in business, speak to some people who already have<br />their own businesses, and ask them to tell you openly about the drawbacks as<br />well as the benefits. It seems that many prospective businessmen and<br />businesswomen often tend to see the rewards without fully realising the hard<br />work and dedication that most businesses require. By all means consider getting<br />into business, but go in with your eyes open and seek out a full panoramic<br />view. <br /><br />2.Integrity and honesty in business are paramount considerations. It's<br />certainly possible to make money by cheating, manipulating and misleading<br />people; but can money made in that way really be enjoyed by the rogue<br />entrepreneur? Look at two well-known businessmen, Robert Maxwell and Richard<br />Branson: two men who created considerable wealth in different ways. Robert<br />Maxwell, who had a business empire, died in 1991 - after deceiving and fiddling<br />money from pension funds. Did Robert Maxwell look happy and contented with his<br />life in the later years? <br /><br />In contrast, consider Richard Branson with his enthusiasm and zest for life. He<br />is widely acknowledged as being a trustworthy and honest person, and his<br />rewarding legal cases against British Airways and GTECH demonstrate his<br />committed views against deceit and bribery. <br /><br />One of the 20th century's leading business tycoons, Lee Iacocca, said: "I have<br />found that being honest is the best technique I can use. Right up front, tell<br />people what you're trying to accomplish and what you're willing to sacrifice to<br />accomplish it." When I mention integrity and honesty, I'm sometimes asked<br />whether I have always been honest and fair in business. Well, my record of<br />integrity is comparatively high - ask anyone who has worked with me - but I<br />have definitely fallen short at times. Never has that been beneficial to me in<br />the long run; it may have resulted in a very short-term transitory gain, but<br />always a long-term loss. <br /><br />3.Look at your potential business from the viewpoint of what you are going to<br />give - the products or services you will provide - in preference to what you<br />are intending to receive from the business. You are far less likely to succeed<br />if you approach business with a money-grabbing, insincere attitude. I think it<br />was the American business coach, Napoleon Hill, who said: "If you don't look<br />after your customers, someone else will." <br /><br />4.Preferably base your business around what you enjoy doing. After all, if your<br />business proves to be successful, you may be spending many years in your chosen<br />business field so it's important to be happy in your work. If you don't really<br />enjoy creating the products or services you're providing, it will often show<br />through to your customers in terms of lack of quality in the products or<br />services, and they will tend to avoid your business in the long run. <br /><br />5.Be cautious about getting involved in business with family or friends. First<br />and foremost, working together in business can sometimes be highly detrimental<br />to those personal relationships. <br /><br />The business environment is often quite different to the social environment:<br />critical decisions, sometimes very harsh ones, frequently have to be made in<br />business; and business management is seldom easy. Understandably a member of<br />the family or a friend may have more difficulty in accepting your managerial<br />decisions than another employee would. Provided there is a totally clear and<br />precise understanding of the working relationship, it may succeed - assuming of<br />course that everyone involved keeps to that understanding. However, people and<br />circumstances change, so that understanding can rarely remain static. <br /><br />6.Put agreements down in writing. For major agreements I think it's important<br />to have a solicitor at least oversee the agreement, but many agreements do not<br />necessarily need the involvement of a solicitor; just a very simple written<br />statement signed by everyone involved can be a great help. Two people involved<br />in a verbal conversation will later tend to have different recollections of<br />their conversation - sometimes their recollections will be widely different -<br />and this differentiation effect increases as time passes. <br /><br />Writing down agreements has three other benefits: (a) it serves to clarify what<br />is being agreed because we have to decide how to express the concept clearly in<br />writing; (b) the process of writing down the concept will sometimes spark off<br />new business ideas or possibilities; (c) a written agreement helps to<br />discourage fraud, although it's thankfully relatively uncommon. If fraud occurs<br />despite having the written agreement, the agreement makes it more likely that<br />the case can be proven and due compensation received. <br /><br />7.Have great respect for risk. Business is frequently about risk-taking since<br />we can rarely be sure of the outcome that will result from a particular<br />business decision. Good business management involves controlled risk-taking:<br />assess the options, estimate the gain from each option, and evaluate the risks<br />associated with each option before making a major decision. <br /><br /><br />It's often best to start small and build your business on your profits. I know<br />of several businesses where the proprietors put considerable money into their<br />businesses, sometimes even borrowing money by re-mortgaging their houses, only<br />to see their businesses quickly fail. A business venture is an exciting<br />prospect for many new entrepreneurs, and their vision sometimes becomes<br />distorted by a kind of false optimism or rose-coloured glasses. There's<br />certainly no point in being pessimistic about a new enterprise, but look at<br />everything rationally and realistically - do some serious "what if?" thinking. <br /><br />For example, many shopkeepers see their profits decline when a new large<br />supermarket or chain store opens nearby. If you are considering setting up your<br />own shop, it's naive to ignore those possibilities - that might seem obvious,<br />but some people do that. <br /><br />Research carefully before you commit any money to a new business, and take<br />limited risks at each stage of expansion. <br /><br />Thank you for answering my questions. <br /><br />You're very welcome. I hope that reading about some of my experiences will be<br />useful to other people. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Copyright © Richard Hanson, Crispin Boylan 1998. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />    </td></tr></table>
