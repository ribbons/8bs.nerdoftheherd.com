Humberside<br />                       DN20 9NH<br /><br />Price:-		`6.00 to 8BS Members<br />-------                ( Quote Membership I.D. when ordering )<br /><br /><br /> So, here we are again, yet another inimitably incisive, interesting,<br />incalculably informative insight into i've run out of words starting with<br />i so I'll get on with ( Oooh, hang on, interminable, how COULD I have<br />missed that one? ) it; The Review.<br /> This compilation is a hole lot better than the last one wot I looked at.<br />I felt perhaps I had done that an injustice, until I looked at some of the<br />reviews published at the time of it's original release, and found that<br />they weren't overly complimentary either.<br /> Anyroadup, that's history, and this is now, even though wot I'm now<br />reviewing is historical, if you see what I mean? DO try and keep up, or we<br />will be here even longe  YES OK NEIL, I HEAR YOU.  SO impatient these<br />upstart Essex boys!<br /> We have four games on this compilation, as follows:-<br /><br />				FIRETRACK<br />				---------<br /> It took me a little while to work out why this game looked so familiar<br />when, as far as I could remember, I had not played it before. The CLANG of<br />the penny dropping must have been heard over most of North London. This is<br />a Space Invaders clone! True, there are a few differences in that the<br />entire screen scrolls downwards ( and don't THAT make yer eyes go funny<br />when it stops? ), you can move up and down as well as sideways, and your<br />gun fires continuously but, whichever way you unwrap the parcel, there at<br />the heart of it is still good ol' Space Invaders.<br /> I don't like Space Invaders. Nuff said.<br /><br /><br />				BONECRUNCHER<br />                               ------------<br /> Judging by the amount of space given to it in the destructions, I thought<br />before playing it that this would be THE game of the compilation. By their<br />very nature, all compilations, be they audio, video, or software, tend to<br />contain a gem or two, the rest being semi-precious and/or dross. <br /> This is definitely not dross, and the only thing stopping it from being a<br />gem is that it is not unique. It is a copy of an original gem; Repton.<br />Names and places have been changed to protect the innocent, but the<br />inspiration is obvious. <br /> Upon first loading the game, you are greeted by a big green face, which<br />seems to be suffering a severe bout of dyspepsia, giving forth the most<br />enormous belches. On further loadings however, it becomes apparent that<br />this is in fact you, roaring.<br /> You are Bono, no, not the front man for U2, but a dragon. You live by the<br />sea ( in a land called Honnelee, perhaps? ), and have found your niche<br />market supplying soap to the monsters that bathe in the sea around your<br />castle, which is the registered office of " Bono's Bathing Company ". You<br />make your soap to an age-old recipe, by collecting and boiling up the<br />skeletons lying ( what else would they be doing? ) around the castle, and<br />are aided in your business venture by a nice-but-dim partner called Fozzy,<br />who has his uses but tires quickly.<br /> The castle has 22 increasingly hazardous chambers to work your way<br />through, each one on completion gives a password so you can restart the<br />game part-way through, once you have the passwords of course. There are no<br />maps available, but there is a status section at the bottom of the screen,<br />which shows where you are and how you and Fozzy are doing.<br /> There are three types of deadly creatures to contend with; Monsters, with<br />which which you appear to share a common ancestry, but which nonetheless    <br />will kill you as soon as look at you, although you can kill them too and<br />then use their skeleton; Spiders, which can be stunned but not killed, eat<br />your main ingredient if given the chance, and whose bite is fatal to you<br />but not to Fozzy; and Glooks, which are the equivalent to Repton's rocks,<br />except that they are attracted to the smell of soap ( unlike certain small<br />children that I know ), and can suddenly appear from below and trap you.<br />As only a small ( even smaller than Repton ) section of each chamber is on<br />view at any time, these things just seem to appear out of nowhere to make<br />your life a misery, a bit like traffic wardens. ( Apologies to any members<br />who may be one, either Traffic Warden or Glook, no offence intended. )<br /> The similarity to Repton continues with the keys used to control the<br />game, but ends when it comes to the graphics. These are less detailed and<br />fuzzier, and are definitely slower to respond to key presses. It is not me<br />this time!<br /> Inevitably this game has a hard act to follow, but does make an effort to<br />be a bit different, unlike some I have seen. As I surmised, it is indeed<br />THE game of the compilation, but not by virtue of it's originality.<br /><br />				SNAPPER<br />				-------<br /> It took me no time whatever to recognise the origins of this game, see<br />how long it takes you. Little sprite rushes around a maze, eating up dots<br />and occasional fruit, whilst avoiding being itself consumed by nasties.<br />Yes, you got it didn't you? Didn't you? Even with MY limited knowledge of<br />games, I know a Pac-Man ( or Pac-Ms in these 'PC' days? ) when I see one!<br /> This is a nice implementation of the game though, requiring a little bit<br />of planning to enable you to get all you need to get before you get got.<br />As far as I have got, the game holds no surprises, and is really a matter<br />of nimble fingerwork to guide yourself around through each of the thirteen<br />progressively harder screens in pursuit of the ultimate goal - The Acorn.<br /> The graphics are simple, cos that's all they need to be for this game,<br />and if you turn the volume down, the sound effects are OK too. The key<br />responses seem a bit slow, at least that's my excuse for never being able<br />to take advantage of the extra life offered for scoring 15000 points.<br /> Much like it's progenitor, this game will have you saying " Drat! ", and<br />having just ONE more go to try and better your previous effort.<br /><br />				GHOULS<br />                               ------<br /> A nice little platform game, which has you jumping across gaps, onto<br />moving platforms, picking up treasures, and avoiding loadsa nasty things<br />whilst working your way from the bottom to the top of the screen. At least<br />that's what you're supposed to do, within the time limit, in order to get<br />to the next screen. Sad to say, I didn't manage to do it once in all the<br />times I tried! It wasn't the time limit which defeated me, just my lack of<br />timing when trying to jump the gaps or obstacles. I must have spent over<br />an hour trying to perfect my technique, and if I tell you that the longest<br />I managed to last before succumbing was 28 seconds ( and that was only cos<br />I was standing still, trying to hide from the patrolling ghost ), you will<br />get some idea of how many unsuccessful attempts I made! That patrolling<br />ghost, incidentally, has a nasty scowl on it's face until you lose a life,<br />whereupon it exibits a rather large smirk. I had occasion to see this<br />rather more often than I would have liked, but it's a nice touch.<br /> I suppose I could try and blame slow key response again, but I think I<br />will just have to accept that my lack of success is totally due to<br />ineptitude. There is a good game there, which will keep the more digitally<br />adroit amongst you glued to your keyboard. I just wish I could have seen<br />more of it.<br /> Judging from what I DID manage to see, the sounds are nicely restrained<br />( and the ghost doesn't laugh as well as smirk ), and the graphics clear<br />and easy to see, which unfortunately didn't help ME in the slightest.<br /><br /> As I said at the beginning, this is a far better compilation than the<br />previous one I reviewed. It contains a good mix of some of the main types<br />of game, each of which has something to lift it above the average of it's<br />genre. There is something for everyone here, even something for the<br />weekend.						K6X ( Cluke )<br /> <br />    </td></tr></table>
