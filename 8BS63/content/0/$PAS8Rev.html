<br />Play It Again Sam 8 Review<br />By Crispin Boylan (E4W)<br /><br />Title: Play It Again Sam 8<br /><br />Available from: Superior Software<br /><br />Price: `11.95 (`6 for 8BS members)<br /><br />Type: Four games Included:<br />Quest (Action Adventure)<br />Winter Olympiad 88 (Sports)<br />Around The World In 40 Screens (Puzzle/Platform)<br />Mr Wiz (Arcade)<br /><br />Quest<br />-----<br /><br />The first of the three games written by Tony Oakden and published by Superior<br />Software, this is a graphical adventure in which you, Walter Cobra, adventurer<br />extraordinaire are drawn into a mysterious and magical world, which incidently<br />you discover by jumping down a wishing well, which it said to do on a map which<br />you found.  The object you seek is 'The Golden Dragon'.  Having jumped down the<br />well, you remember one vital thing you forgot - the map.  Oh well, as most good<br />adventurers do anyway, you have to stumble along and find the Gold Dragon<br />without the help of said cartographical aid.  <br /><br />The game comprises over 90 graphically different scenes, with many puzzles, and<br />lots of blasting to be done to complete the game.  There is quite a lot to be<br />done in this game, apart from finding the Golden Dragon you also have to get<br />the 12 power crystals and also destroy 3 reactors...no mean feat indeed!  This<br />is a feature packed game, and the best feature being that you have a jet pack<br />which you can use to propel you through some of the screen, however they only<br />work on screens with a special triangular mark, and a technique must be<br />developed of cruising through screens which you cannot use the jet packs in, by<br />firing the pack on a screen which you can.  There are many different enemies<br />which you encounter, each having a different level of toughness, and requiring<br />more shots to kill.  It is quite hard at first, but once you learn that<br />shooting is not the best option, then it becomes easier to traverse the levels.<br />You start the game with a certain amount of energy which must be replenished,<br />and also you have to fight against time.  The puzzles in this game are hard,<br />and there are lots of them, it helps to make a map!<br /><br />The graphics of this game are nice high-res ones, with lots of nice colours,<br />and fluid action.  You can't really fault the graphics and they are perfectly<br />done for the type of game really.  The sound is to put it mildly, weak, with<br />only a few sound effects and absolutely no music, which would have really added<br />to the atmosphere!  In general, gameplay is spot on, but perhaps there is too<br />much needless shooting, as there are already enough objectives without having<br />to kill and dodge things as well!  <br /><br />Winter Olympiad 88<br />------------------<br /><br />This game is originally by Tynesoft, but republished with their permission on<br />the disk, it is typical of the type of games which Tynesoft produced, ie it is<br />a sports game.  You compete against up to 3 opponents, and the winner being the<br />one who has the most gold medals from the events before (or if two players have<br />the same amount of golds, then it is the one with the most silvers).  If you<br />have no friends, then the beeb will help you out by playing the part of them.  <br /><br />The game has six events, the Bob Sled, Speed Skating, Ski Jump, Giant Slalom,<br />Ski Slalom and the Biathlon.  Rather than choose all skiing or all off-piste<br />events as most programmers choose when they make games like this, Tynesoft have<br />gone for a rather nice combination of events, not one actually has similar<br />gameplay to the others.  As is a feature of most athletics games, this one<br />features the fabled finger-tapping!  If you don't know, this is where you have<br />to rapidly press two keys in rythm, one after the other, it definitly brings a<br />whole new feeling of realism - by the end of a lap of speed skating, your<br />fingers feel as if they've been speed skating in real life!  This is more fun<br />than it sounds, especially if playing with friends, you need endurance!  The<br />six events are nicely different, some requiring finger-tapping, but most not. <br />The biathlon is my favourite event on the disk, yuo have to use finger-tapping<br />to ski, and then at regular intervals you need quick reactions to hit the<br />targets on the shooting range.  The best feature of this is that when you<br />reload your gun, instead of using a computer generated sound effect, the tape<br />relay clicks on and off, which sounds quite realistic, well better than a<br />computer sound effect anyway!  Probably the worst event is the Ski Slalom, as<br />the posts just come at you from nowhere, with hardly any indication of where<br />the next one will be!<br /><br />The graphics are quite nice on this game, they are low-resolution high colour<br />modes though, and this creates some nice graphical effects.  There are a lot of<br />nice still pictures on this game though, and a lot of animation is not really<br />required.  It all moves around nicely and is very fun to watch.  Another good<br />thing is the sound, at the end of each event you get the nice ski-sunday tune,<br />which is actually done quite well!  The game is difficult to play, and although<br />I won one gold on my first go, it was more by luck than judgement, and I did<br />absolutely crap in all the other events!  Good fun for one, better for two or<br />more.<br /><br />Around The World in 40 Screens<br />------------------------------<br /><br />Ahh, always the highlight of any compilation, a Repton Game, this was the first<br />new set of screens for the Repton 3 game, and features 40 levels for the little<br />green beast to show what he's made of.  Played in a variety of settings,<br />including America, The Arctic, The Orient, Oceania, and Africa, the levels are<br />nicely designed and varied.  <br /><br />Although this game offers nothing new in the way of gameplay, it is still fun<br />to play, and the new graphics screens offer a lot to the game, it works if you<br />have played the original, and even if you haven't.  For those of you who don't<br />know about Repton, it is basically a game where you as Repton have to collect<br />diamonds, and dodge rocks.  The puzzles are mainly to do with the way rocks are<br />laid out, but there are others, such as monsters who chase you if you crack the<br />egg they live in, spirits who must be guided to their cages to turn the cages<br />into diamonds, and fungus which must be kept at bay to stop it taking over the<br />entire screen.  This is great fun to play, and you can play it at whatever pace<br />you like, from those people who love to just think the whole level over before<br />they play it, or those who go at the levels like a bull in a china shop, it<br />will have universal appeal.  The thing is though, that on later levels you<br />cannot view the maps of the levels, making the game much harder!  A password<br />scheme is included so you never have to start from the beginning, and there is<br />also an editor with the game, which allows you to create your own new levels,<br />even using your own specially designed graphics!<br /><br />The graphics of this game, although low-resoltion are very well done, and it<br />seems as thought every trick in the book is used by the programmers to get the<br />game to work at it's optimum speed.  The whole thing is very graphically<br />intensive, and it is great that it is animated so highly and all seems to work<br />together so well.  The sound is also good, a nice pleasant tune plays away in<br />the background, and the one gripe I have is that the 'ping' sound when you<br />collect diamonds is a little shrill for my young ears!  You can't go wrong with<br />gameplay like this, and the editor offers unlimited level creation, you can<br />have hours of fun designing levels!<br /><br />Mr Wiz<br />------<br /><br />This is something of a strange game from Superior, strange in two ways firstly<br />because it is rather an odd one out on this compilation, and also because it is<br />actually a worse arcade conversion than one done by another company, this is<br />very rare for Superior.  It is based on the old Mr Do! game in the coin-op<br />arcades, basically you are Mr Do, and you have to collect the cherries which<br />are burried in the soil, by making your own pathways through it.  The aim is to<br />collect all the cherries on the screen, but this is made harder by the fact<br />that you have to outrun the bad guys who chase you around the pathways you<br />make, and some even make their own.  The reason it is just not as good as the<br />other game (Mr Ee! by Micropower) is purely a matter of the graphics.  In Mr<br />Ee! you get nicely designed really colourful characters, and this one looks<br />rather dull in comparison.  The gameplay is hardly complexed, so it is no<br />surprise that both games play pretty much the same, and when something like<br />this happens you have to go for the graphics of a game, and Mr Wiz sadly loses<br />out.  Superior can be forgiven though, as it was one of their earliest games,<br />and also you must remember that Micropower had been doing games for several<br />years before Superior, and they were eventually overtaken.  <br /><br />As I have stated, the graphics in this game are none too hot, they are, shall<br />we say, functional.  Being in a low-res mode, they are never going to be the<br />pinacle of high definition, but the colours used are quite nice in a barren<br />sort of way.  The sound is adequate, though not etravagent, it is not too<br />annoying either.  The gameplay is good, and just what you need, some mindless<br />moving after a hard days work.  <br /><br />Overall<br />-------<br /><br />This is a nicely put together compilation, and the games really do complement<br />each other, a nice mix of strategy, fun and puzzle solving make this an ideal<br />compilation if you like all sorts of games.<br /><br />Score:  80%<br /><br />    </td></tr></table>
