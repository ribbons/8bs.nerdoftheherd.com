	<h1>About</h1>
	
	<p>This is an online conversion of the 8-Bit Software Magazine,
	developed by me, <a href="https://nerdoftheherd.com/">Matt Robinson</a>.&nbsp;
	8-Bit Software was a public domain software library and floppy disk based
	magazine for the owners of BBC computers, which was published between 1990
	and 1998.&nbsp;
	<a href="http://8bs.com/">More about 8BS</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Why?</h2>
	
	<p>The magazines are available elsewhere online, but not in a format
	that makes them easy to access or navigate.&nbsp; Also, searching for
	obscure BBC information contained in the magazines doesn't usually turn
	up any useful information from search engines.</p>
	
	<h2>Status</h2>
	
	<p>All of the magazine issues are now online, but there are still
	plenty of refinements that I intend to make to the handling of
	magazine content.&nbsp; This includes improvements to the Mode 0
	conversion and converting BBC format images.</p>
