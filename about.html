			<h1>About</h1>
			
			<p>This is an online conversion of the 8-Bit Software Magazine using
			custom software written by me, Matt Robinson.&nbsp;
			8-Bit Software was a floppy disk based magazine for the owners of BBC
			computers, which was published between 1990 and 1998.&nbsp;
			<a href="http://bbcmicro.net/old-8bs/index_.htm">More about 8BS</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>Rationale</h2>
			
			<p>The magazine disk images are available elsewhere online, but to read
			the disk images, a BBC emulator (or BBC) is required.&nbsp; This makes
			them difficult to access easily, and searching for obscure BBC
			information contained in the magazines doesn't return much, or more
			frequently any information from search engines.</p>
			
			<h2>Aims</h2>
			
			<p>The aim of this site is to eventually present all 8-Bit Software
			magazines for viewing online in as close to its original style as is
			practical.&nbsp; This should be in a standards compliant and accessible
			format.</p>
			
			<h2>Current status</h2>
			
			<p>Presently there is only a single issue available as a prototype,
			while some of the bigger issues are sorted out.&nbsp; You can find a
			list of the bugs and enhancements

			a bug in Bugzilla</a> for me.&nbsp; If you'd like to get in touch, or
			make any suggestions for improvements (technical or otherwise) then
