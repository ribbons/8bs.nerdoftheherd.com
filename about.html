	<h1>About</h1>
	
	<p>This is an online conversion of the 8-Bit Software Magazine using
	custom software written by me, <a href="http://www.nerdoftheherd.com/">Matt
	Robinson</a>.&nbsp;
	8-Bit Software was a public domain software library and floppy disk based
	magazine for the owners of BBC computers, which was published between 1990
	and 1998.&nbsp;
	<a href="http://8bs.com/">More about 8BS</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Rationale</h2>
	
	<p>The magazine disk images are available elsewhere online, but to read
	the disk images, a BBC emulator (or BBC) is required.&nbsp; This makes
	them difficult to access easily, and searching for obscure BBC
	information contained in the magazines doesn't usually turn up any
	information from search engines.</p>
	
	<h2>Aims</h2>
	
	<p>The aim of this site is to eventually present all of the 8-Bit Software
	magazines for viewing online in as close to their original style as is
	practical.&nbsp; This should be in a standards compliant and accessible
	format.</p>
	
	<h2>Current status</h2>
	
	<p>Presently not all of the issues are available online, while I develop the
	conversion and iron out the bugs.&nbsp; You can find a list of the currently
	pending bugs and enhancements
