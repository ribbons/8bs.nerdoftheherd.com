			<h1>About</h1>
			
			<p>This is an online conversion of the 8-Bit Software Magazine using
			custom software written by me, Matt Robinson.&nbsp;
			8-Bit Software was a floppy disk based magazine for the owners of BBC computers,
			which was published between 1990 and 1998.&nbsp;
			<a href="http://bbcmicro.net/old-8bs/index_.htm">More about 8BS</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>Background</h2>
			
			<p>The magazine disk images are available elsewhere online, but to read
			the disk images, a BBC emulator (or BBC) is required.&nbsp; This makes
			them
			difficult to access easily, and very difficult to search.&nbsp; The aim of
			this site is to present as much of the magazine for viewing online as is
			practical, as well as enabling users to find obscure BBC information via
			search engines.</p>
			
			<h2>Aims</h2>
			
			<p>This project aims to eventually present all 8-Bit Software magazines
			online, in a standards compliant and accessible format.</p>
			
			<h2>Current status</h2>
			
			<p>Presently there is only a single issue available as a prototype,
			while some of the bigger issues are sorted out.&nbsp; You can find a
			list of the bugs and enhancements
			<a href="http://bugzilla.nerdoftheherd.com/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;product=8BS+Online+Conversion&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED">in Bugzilla</a>.</p>
