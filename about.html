    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>This is an online conversion of the 8-Bit Software Magazine,
    developed by me, <a href="https://nerdoftheherd.com/">Matt Robinson</a>.&nbsp;
    8-Bit Software was a public domain software library and floppy disk based
    magazine for the owners of BBC computers, which was published between 1990
    and 1998.&nbsp;

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>When I originally started working on this conversion in 2007 I thought
    it would be an interesting challenge to generate HTML pages which looked as
    close as possible to how the original articles did on the BBC, but could
    also have their content indexed by search engines.</p>

    <p>Happily this challenge has become easier over time as browsers have
    advanced, and the emergence of the amazing
    <a href="https://bbc.godbolt.org/">jsbeeb</a> in 2014 allowed me to give
    visitors the option of running the original magazines or selected programs
    directly in their browser.</p>

    <h2>Status</h2>

    <p>All of the magazines are now online, but there are still
    plenty of refinements that I intend to make to the handling of
    their content.&nbsp; This includes improvements to the Mode 0
    conversion and the menus.</p>

    <h2>Credits</h2>
