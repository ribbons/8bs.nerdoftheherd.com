<div id="content">
    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>This is an online conversion of the 8-Bit Software Magazine,
    developed by me, <a href="https://nerdoftheherd.com/">Matt Robinson</a>.&nbsp;
    8-Bit Software was a public domain software library and floppy disk based
    magazine for the owners of BBC computers, which was published between 1990
    and 1998.&nbsp;
    <a href="http://8bs.com/">More about 8BS</a>.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>The magazines are available elsewhere online, but not in a format
    that makes them easy to access or navigate.&nbsp; Also, searching for
    obscure BBC information contained in the magazines doesn't usually turn
    up any useful information from search engines.</p>

    <h2>Status</h2>

    <p>All of the magazine issues are now online, but there are still
    plenty of refinements that I intend to make to the handling of
    magazine content.&nbsp; This includes improvements to the Mode 0
    conversion and the menus.</p>

    <h2>Credits</h2>
