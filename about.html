<div id="content">
    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>This is an online conversion of the 8-Bit Software Magazine,
    developed by me, <a href="https://nerdoftheherd.com/">Matt Robinson</a>.&nbsp;
    8-Bit Software was a public domain software library and floppy disk based
    magazine for the owners of BBC computers, which was published between 1990
    and 1998.&nbsp;
    <a href="http://8bs.com/">More about 8BS</a>.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>The magazines are available elsewhere online, but not in a format that is
    faithful to the original, that makes the issues easy to navigate or allows
    emulating the programs straight away in your browser.</p>

    <h2>Status</h2>

    <p>All of the magazines are now online, but there are still
    plenty of refinements that I intend to make to the handling of
    their content.&nbsp; This includes improvements to the Mode 0
    conversion and the menus.</p>

    <h2>Credits</h2>

    <p>This site is using:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The amazing <a href="https://bbc.godbolt.org/">jsbeeb</a> for
        emulating the issue content.</li>
        <li>The excellent <a href="http://galax.xyz/TELETEXT/INDEX.HTM">Teletext
        font by Galax</a> for displaying 'Mode 7' pages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Comments, suggestions, or bugs?</h2>
